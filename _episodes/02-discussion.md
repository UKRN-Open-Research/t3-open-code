## Breakout rooms

Find a breakout room and have a chat with the other people there about preprints.
Make a note of points that come up in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ceDUd9PAcdZS25rHBFgnRV5PKMPgeuPErL8-k44IsRg/edit?usp=sharing " target="_blank">collaborative editing document</a> (**Group Discussion** section).
You might describe your experiences with preprints, some of the advantages they offer (as a reader or author), and some concerns you may have or may have heard about.
If other people have written something similar, you can add '+' to their entry, and whether you agree or disagree you can use a comment to add your own experience for context.
