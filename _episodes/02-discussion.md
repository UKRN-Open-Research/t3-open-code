## Breakout rooms

Find an appropriate breakout room and have a chat with the other people there.
Make a note of points that come up in the <a href="{{ site.collaborative_notes }}" target="_blank">collaborative editing document</a> (**Group Discussion** section).
You might describe your experiences, some of the advantages registration offers (as a reader or author), and some concerns you may have or may have heard about.
If other people have written something similar, you can add '+' to their entry, and whether you agree or disagree you can use a comment to add your own experience for context.
