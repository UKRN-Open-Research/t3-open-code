## Breakout rooms

Find an appropriate breakout room and have a chat with the other people there.
Make a note of points that come up in the <a href="{{ site.collaborative_notes }}" target="_blank">collaborative editing document</a> (**Group Discussion** section).
You might describe your experiences, some of the advantages sharing code offers (as a producer of the code or a user), and some concerns you may have or may have heard about.
If other people have written something similar, you can add '+' to their entry, and whether you agree or disagree you can use a comment to add your own experience for context.

> ## Breakout rooms `30 min`
> Have a chat with others in your breakout room. 
> - Briefly introduce yourselves to each other!
> - What are the most important points or skills to cover in your workshop? What concepts do you think your attendees will be most unclear on or need the most guidance on?
> - What do you (the trainer) not know about sharing code that you want to learn before you give a workshop?
> - How will you amend the template for your workshop? What is missing? What would you leave out or change?
>
