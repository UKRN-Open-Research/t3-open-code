## UKRN Open Research Training

You're here to get involved in helping your colleagues share preprints of their work.
We can help you put together a workshop which will make it easier to achieve real changes in your colleagues' behaviour, and you can bring your specialist knowledge of the field and experience.

> ## Approach
> * **Practical workflow change**: we want to produce actual changes to how people work by tweaking their default workflow
> * **No homework** for busy researchers (including you!)
> * **Better is good** - we want everyone doing something a bit better by the end
{: .callout}

### Course structure

Today we'll start with discussions about the pros and cons of preprints, and think about what a workshop on preprints might cover and how it will meet your colleagues' needs.
We'll be giving you some tips on how to deliver workshops, courtesy of our guest-presenter Louise from Bristol Institute of Teaching and Learning, and an introduction to our Workshop Builder Tool and our Resource List.
At the end, there will be a large block of time for you to use the Workshop Builder Tool (or something else if you prefer) to build your own workshop to deliver to your colleagues.

> ## What you'll get out of this course
> * A Workshop website you can use to help your colleagues with sharing data
> * Some ideas for how to engage colleagues and manage the workshop
> * Membership of an enthusiastic community of like-minded researchers in various disciplines

### Preprints

Preprints are a bit different in practice between various fields - that's why we can't just produce a one-size-fits-all guide and be done with it!

> ## Activity `10 min`
> Write a sentence or two in the **Introductions section** of the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ceDUd9PAcdZS25rHBFgnRV5PKMPgeuPErL8-k44IsRg/edit?usp=sharing
" target="_blank">collaborative editing document</a> that tells your fellow attendees a little bit about yourself, your field, and your background with preprints.
